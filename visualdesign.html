	<h2>Artifact #3</h2>
	
	<h2>Artist's Statement:</h2>
		<p>I made this project by using the shape tools, and perspective grid tool. and pen tools. I added spongebob houses from the original show. I included stop signs too. The hardest part was all the spongebob houses because they were curvy. The easiest part was the streets.</p>

	<h2>Artifact #6</h2>
	
	<h2>Artist's Statement:</h2>
		<p>I made this project only using illustrator. Inside of Illustrator, I used the pen tool. The elements I included were many from the BLM movement and the death of George Floyd, such as: Police Officers, George Floyd, Police Dogs, Police Cars and a sun in the b	background. I choose to make the story about police brutality and how a police officer was killing a black man.
